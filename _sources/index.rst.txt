JAX RB: Riemannian Brownian motion on manifolds
===============================================
JAX RB is a library for Riemannian Brownian motion on constrained manifolds embedded in a vector space, or on quotient of such manifolds by a compact group. The theory is developed in [NgSo24]_. Please refer to the `github repository <https://github.com/dnguyend/jax-rb>`_ for installation instruction.
